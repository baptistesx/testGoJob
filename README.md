Exercise:

Closest to zero

Write a function “closestToZero” described by the following specifications:

    given an array of positive and negative integers, it returns the closest number to zero

    if the closest number in input could be either negative or positive, the function returns the positive one

    if the input array is undefined or empty, the function returns 0

Examples:

when input is [8, 5, 10] it must returns 5

when input is [5, 4, -9, 6, -10, -1, 8] it must return -1

when input is [8, 2, 3, -2] it must return 2

when input is [2, 0], it must returns 0, as 0 is ... the closest number to 0
